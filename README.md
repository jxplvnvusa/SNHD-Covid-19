# SNHD-Covid-19
My Google Sheets with Southern Nevada Health District COVID-19 zip code count data
Since the beginning of the pandemic and close of workplace in March, 2020, I have applied my descriptive statistics training to the data from the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD). 
In the beginning, it was simply new cases per day matching what I had learned from the Johns Hopkins Teach out on Epidemiology and Covid-19 on Coursera.org. By May, I was discovering the counts per day were changing as new information was incorporated into the data according to the SNHD guidelines*. Then I found a journal on Statistical Communications in Infectious Diseases and tried to make the data more accessible. Finally, I stumbled across the MinutePhysics YouTube video using a Log x Log scale illustration of case counts vs New Cases over the last seven days and felt that was the way to go.
Not being skilled in animation or the tools they used, I found a way to coax Google Sheets to show a static graph of the data with date tags which served the same purpose. These I used in my role as member of the city's Senior Citizens' Advisory Board and general mitigation advocate.
Now the complexity is to a point I am hesitant going further without a more neutral and stable platform for the data from which I can more quickly calculate per capita counts and graphs from there.
