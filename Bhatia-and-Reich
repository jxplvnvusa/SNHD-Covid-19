Bhatia & Reich have given me an example a few months ago at Reich's Minute Physics YouTube channel on "how to know if we are winning" against COVID-19. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc) There he references Ashib Bhatia's http://aatishb.com/covidtrends site. I thought it was a good idea and sought to do the same thing with my limited skills. 
Now I would like to compare trends and notice any differences, if any, and seek to strengthen local efforts in limiting the spread of the virus until we can go back to work.
Here is an example of what I have been able to do so far.

I would like to look further into Ashib's code and file management to closer reprelicate his work in order to provide comparison capabilities for improvement.
Peace.
